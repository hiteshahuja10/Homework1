My scene represents a bedroom that is created using various unity assets. Some objects that are included in my scene are a bed, chair, lamp, tv, and desk.
I was inspired to make this because one day I would like to design my room similar to this scene where I can have my own personal couch and tv in my room
and also still have enough space for my computer desk and bed. The main character in my scene is the robot. Most of the unity assets were from the "Brick Project Studio"
pack in the Unity Store and the robot was from the "Robot Kyle" pack in the Unity Store.

Objects Used: 15 Unity Assets and 1 GameObject (31 Points)
- Floor (1pt, Cube GameObject)
- Robot (2pt, Unity Asset Store)
- Lamp (2pt, Unity Asset Store)
